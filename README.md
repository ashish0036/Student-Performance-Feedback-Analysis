Student Performance & Feedback Analysis
Project Overview
This project involves analyzing student performance, course activity, and feedback data using Python. The goal is to identify patterns that can help improve student engagement, learning outcomes, and course design. The analysis was done using data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and data visualization techniques.

Dataset
The project uses the following CSV files:

students.csv: Contains student demographics and information.

course_activity.csv: Records of students' engagement with course activities.

feedback.csv: Feedback provided by students on course content and teaching methods.

Steps Taken
Data Cleaning:

Loaded the datasets and checked for missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.

Handled missing data through imputation or removal and ensured all columns were in the correct data types.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Explored the relationships between student demographics, course activity participation, and performance.

Identified correlations and trends in the data.

Generated descriptive statistics to summarize key features.

Visualization:

Created visualizations such as bar charts, scatter plots, and histograms to highlight trends and patterns.

Plotted performance against engagement levels and student feedback to identify areas for improvement.

Insights & Recommendations:

Analyzed feedback data to provide actionable insights for improving course content and delivery.

Identified factors influencing student success and recommended strategies to personalize learning and enhance engagement.

Tools & Libraries Used
Python: Primary language used for data manipulation and analysis.

Pandas: For data cleaning and analysis.

Matplotlib & Seaborn: For visualizing data.

NumPy: For numerical operations.

Conclusion
This analysis provides actionable insights that can help educators optimize teaching strategies, improve student performance, and enhance course content and delivery.
